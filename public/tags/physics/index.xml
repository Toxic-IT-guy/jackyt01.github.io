      <description>1. A generalized coordinate In mechanics, objects of negligible size in motion are usually treated as mass points, its position is determined by r(x, y, z), abbreviated as r. Its velocity and acceleration are For a system, if it contains N particles, in order to uniquely determine the positions of all particles, 3N coordinates are required, which are called degrees of freedom. In a system with a degree of freedom</description>
