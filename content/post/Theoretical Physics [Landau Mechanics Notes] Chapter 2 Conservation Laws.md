  ## 6. Energy 
  
  During the motion of a mechanical system, the 2s quantities 
  $$q_{i}$$
  and 
  $$\dot{q_{i}}$$ (i = 1, 2,s)
  which specify the state of the system vary with time. 
  There exist, however, functions of these quantities whose values remain constant during the motion, and depend only on the initial conditions.
  Such functions are called integrals of the motion.
